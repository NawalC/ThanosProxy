# Thanos Proxy Setup üöÄ

## Goal üéØ
Set up a unified proxy to access:
- **Thanos Frontend** üåê
- **Remote Write** ‚úçÔ∏è
- **Thanos Receiver** üì•

## Enhancing Prometheus for Long-Term Storage üíæ
Thanos extends Prometheus by providing scalable and durable long-term storage, ensuring that your metrics data is preserved and accessible over extended periods.

## Components Overview üõ†Ô∏è

### Thanos Frontend üåê
A web interface to visualise metrics and graphs effortlessly.  
üñ•Ô∏è Accessible via proxy with secure authentication and low latency.

### Remote Write ‚úçÔ∏è
Enables sending metrics data to Thanos for centralized storage.  
üì° Ensure data ingestion works flawlessly through the proxy with 99.9% availability.

### Thanos Receiver üì•
Handles incoming metrics data efficiently for processing and storage.  
üì• Fully functional via proxy with real-time updates and error-free data flow.
