A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. Here is a basic outline of how a proxy works in a response structure:

1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request to the proxy server instead of directly to the target server.
2. **Proxy Server**: The proxy server receives the client's request, processes it, and forwards it to the target server.
3. **Target Server Response**: The target server processes the request and sends the response back to the proxy server.
4. **Proxy Server Response**: The proxy server receives the response from the target server, processes it if necessary (e.g., caching, filtering), and then forwards it to the client.

### Example

```plaintext
Client -> Proxy Server -> Target Server
Client <- Proxy Server <- Target Server
```

### Benefits of Using a Proxy

- **Anonymity**: Hides the client's IP address.
- **Security**: Can filter malicious content.
- **Caching**: Reduces load times by storing copies of frequently accessed resources.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to certain websites or services.

### Types of Proxies

- **Forward Proxy**: Used to forward requests from a client to a server.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Used to forward requests from a server to a client, often used for load balancing.

### Example Configuration (Nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

This configuration forwards requests from `example.com` to a backend server.
